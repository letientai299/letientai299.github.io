_This is my first post ever in this site. This do not aim to all kind of the
reader, at best, this aim to the Information Technology student, who will
become a programmer someday. So if you are already an experienced one, or you
find it not useful, just skip it :). But, you're always welcome to give me
feedback to improve this post, or share with us your experience by leaving a

OK, so you are an fresher who've just finished your study in college, or even
better, you are an high school student, want to write code in a professional
manner some day. Following tips may help you:


Practice touch typing
---------------------

When you become a programmer, most of time you play with text file in the
monitor, and mostly about edit them (until the day you grow to higher level, do
more reading than writing). Do you want to spend your time turn your head down,
looking for the right key to touch? Do you want to disrupting your though by
press Backspace, fix a typo just because you miss pressed some keys?

But do programmers mostly spend time thinking, don't they? Yes, it's true.
Programming is about thinking and solving problems, and the better programmer
usually writes less code. But do you trust a driver who don't know how to
control his car. The same with programmer, no one can trust your skill if you
couldn't control your keyboard.

OK, so how fast? That's not really matter. The thing is: you are just need to
be able to know where is the appropriate key you need and move your finger on
it, like a habit, without interrupt your thinking. Also, know your keyboard can
help you trigger the shortcuts faster, and make your work done faster. This is
not only apply for programming, but also all other jobs for which we need a
computer.[^my_speed]

Learn to manage things
----------------------




Understand your tools.
--------------------------------------

You're probably using an browser to view this post. Did you know that `Alt-D`
gives focus on the address bar, also select all the text? Did you know that
that shortcut work on most of the browser, include Chrome, IE, Firefox, Opera;
and it also work on Window Explorer? And did you know there is another shortcut
give you the same feature: `Ctrl-L` [^alternative_alt_d]? Did you ever try
hitting `?` on Facebook, Twitter, or Github? If not, try it now, you are
missing one of the best feature of those sites to make your browsing easier.

Did you ever read the manual of your tools?

Let me tell you my story. I used to be like this: try the tool, disappointed
about it, find other tools that may fix my problems, sometime I could find one,
sometime I have to accept the fact that nothing work for me out of the box, and
I end up mixing a lot of tool just for use each one a little bit. Later, I
really that all the feature I need are already supported in one of my tools.
It's just because I were too lazy to learn its features. Sound familiar?

Is it about remember all the shortcuts of the tool? No, the shortcuts is just a
one of the topics about how to use your tool effectively. There a lot of thing
you need to know in order to _understand_ it:

- How to tweak your tool to suit your needs?
- How to tune its performance?
- How it interacts with other tools in your box?
- What it really does in the background for each command you give to it?
- How to improve it, or even better, extend it, become an contributor?
- ...

Take Vim[^vim] for an example about different between memorizing all shortcuts
with understand the tool. To a non-programmer it's just a text editor that very
hard to use, and a very unfriendly GUI since it work best inside the command
line. To a beginner[^vim_beginner], it seems too hard to remember every single
shortcuts and commands. Things become more headache when you combine them
together. But when you learn its concepts, realize that [Vim is a editing
language ](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/#language), your editing skill
with Vim will be improve significantly.

Is great tool/software suppose to work out of the box with minimal effort from
the user? Yes, of course, that's also the first thing to consider when I choose
new tool. But there's not alway the right thing that work out of the box
without any disappointment, unless you build it yourself. We have to adapt or
customize it, more or less.

You cannot imagine how powerful you are when you mastering your tools. Spend
your time to learn your tools, it's worth.

Mastering thing one by one

Why post this?
--------------

Because I wish I could know these tips before, when I'm still a high school
student. Back in that time, the most things I do with computer is playing game.
It's took me 4 years in college trying to catch up with my fellows, and
realizing that all the gaming stuff I've done before won't help me make my
dream come true, whatever the dream is.

Now I don't want to catch up with my friend any more. Their got their way,
follow their dreams. I got my way, burn my fire. And I believe you do have your
fire, too. But if you don't start now, you may end up like me, regret about
your wasted time and never have the chance to regain it.

Learn my tips, learn other people's tips. Start practice now. Become a better programmer than us.

Good luck!

[^alternative_alt_d]: Actually, the two shortcut not the same. On some Unix file manager, `Ctrl-L` gives focus to address bar, while`Alt-D` behavior is depend on the software. For example: it do nothing on Nautilus/Ubuntu, but make a bookmark for your folder in Mac OS. Since I mostly use Window, I prefer `Alt-D` because it just need one hand to press.

[^vim]: If you don't know about Vim, it's a 20 years text editor, an advance tool for programmer and is installed as default in most Linux distro. Learning Vim will make you think again about effective typing. Read more [about Vim]( http://www.vim.org/about.php)

[^vim_beginner]: Honestly, I'm still a beginner in Vim. Too many things to learn in that little 10 MB software, but it's never get boring.

[^my_speed]: For your information, my speed is about 50 WPM when typing normal English (around 70 WPM for Vietnamese, using VNI input method). But when programming, it's really different, because sometime your IDE can generate boilerplate code for you, sometime, you have to write it all, from scratch. So, don't bother with such question like: How fast can a programmer type? You don't really need to beat world typing record. Just as fast as type without need to look in the keyboard.
