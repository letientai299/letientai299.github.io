Things I'd done within 4 months for that project:

- Read and do exercise 60% of the book
 [Implementing Domain-Specific Languages with Xtext and Xtend](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/implementing-domain-specific-languages-xtext-and-xtend)
- Learn and use [Xtend](https://eclipse.org/xtend/) in production. It's a
  nice JVM functional language, but I would prefer Scala over it.

- Learn Scala, read 32/35 chapters in the book [Programming in Scala, 2nd
  Edition](http://booksites.artima.com/programming_in_scala_2ed). Honestly,
  I can't remember everything I learnt in that book. But, the way the authors
  teaching the language design, practice, and programming princicles is
  enlightened. That's a much read.

- Learn about Property-based testing and use
  [ScalaCheck](https://www.scalacheck.org/) for test the core library of my
  project. Actually, I was first read about Property-based testing, then
  ScalaCheck, and finally decided to give Scala a try.
