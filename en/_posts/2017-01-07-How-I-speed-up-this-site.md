_WIP_


Things I've done
----------------

- Inline css
- Disable disqus by default



Github Pages is awesome
-----------------------
- HTTPS
- Gzip enabled ([verify here](http://checkgzipcompression.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fletientai299.github.io%2F))


Have no idea
------------

- Lighthouse complains about markdown code fence color constrasting. Fixing it
  is hard, and, my developer eyes feel comfortable reading those color anyway :)
