This is my first post ever in this site. This do not aim to all kind of the
reader, at best, this aim to the Information Technology student, who will
become a programmer someday. So if you are already an experienced one, or you
find it not useful, just skip it :). But, you're always welcome to give me
feedback to improve this post, or share with us your experience by leaving a
comment.

Ok, so you are an fresher who just finish your study in collecge, or even
better, you are an high school student, want to write code in a professional
manner some day. Following tips may help you:

* [Practice touch typing](#practice-touch-typing)
* [Learn to manage things](#learn-to-manage-things)
* [Understand your tools](#understand-your-tools)
* [Mastering thing one by one](#mastering-thing-one-by-one)

Practice touch typing
---------------------

When you become a programmer, most of time you play with text file in the
monitor, and mostly about edit them (until the day you grow to higher level, do
more reading than writing). Do you want to spend your time turn your head down,
looking for the right key to touch? Yes, it's true that programming is about
thinking and solving problems, and the better programmer usually write less
code. But do you trust a driver who don't know how to control his car. The same
with programmer, no one can trust your skill if you could even control your
keybvoard.

Ok, so how fast? That's not really matter. The thing is: you are just need to
be able to know where is the appropriate key you need and move your finger on
it, like a habit, without interupt your thinking. Also, know your keyboard can
help you trigger the shortcuts faster, and make your work done faster. This is
not only apply for programming, but also all other modern job.

For your information, I take about 50 WPM when typing normal English (around 70
WPm for Vietname, using VNI input method). But when programming, it's really
uncountable, because, sometime your IDE can generate boilerplate code for you,
sometime, you have to write it all, from scatch. So, don't bother with such
question like: How fast can a programmer type?

Learn to manage things
----------------------




Don't just use, understand your tools.
--------------------------------------




Mastering thing one by one
--------------------------



Why post this?
--------------

Because I wish I could know these tips before, when I'm still a high school
student. Back in that time, the most things I do with computer is playing game.
It's took me 4 years in college trying to catch up with my fellows, and
realizing that all the gaming stuff I've done before won't help me make my
dream come true, whatever the dream is.

Now I don't want to catch up with my friend any more. Their got their way,
follow their dreams. I got my way, burn my fire. And I believe you do have your
fire, too. But if you don't start now, you may end up like me, regret about
your wasted time and never have the chance to regain it.

Learn my tips, learn other people's tips. Start practice now. Become a better programmer than us.

Good luck!
