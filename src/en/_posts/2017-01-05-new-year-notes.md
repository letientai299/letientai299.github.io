Side projects
-------------

- Make [userscript-auto-toc](https://github.com/letientai299/userscript-auto-toc) production-ready.
- Enhance this site.
- Read [CLRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms)
- (Hope, just hope) Read volume 1 of [the algorithm bibles](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/taocp.html)


Contributing
------------

- Contribute my first Wikipedia article. Translate [Carmichael
  Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmichael_function) into Vietnamese
  seems good for this purpose. When I was a student, I'd only know about
  [Euler's totient function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function).

- Complete the Vietnamese translation for [Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university)

- Contribute on [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [vscode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/)


Health
------

- Stop being fat belly.
- Be able to do 100 push-ups in a row.
- Get that fucking 6-packs.


Other
