About me
--------

Hi, friend!

Thanks for visiting my blog. My name is Le Tien Tai (in English, I think it
would be Tai Le Tien, for you not to be confused).

I began write code since 2011, when I went to college. Back in the summer of 2014, I started my first job as a Java developer. Most of my projects until now is about Android and Web. Sometimes, I also work with C++ (they are JNI modules in Android applications).

I love problems solving, and programming is a kind of that such thing. Besides
that, I also love cooking, reading, and playing music.

Currently, I'm learning the Unix utilities: bash, zsh, vim, ssh,... Vim's
actually my main editor on all operating system (well, I even try to use
Vim-like key binding as much as possible for my daily work).

About this site
---------------

On this site, I share my thoughts and experience. Knowledge should be sharing.
Let's share to be share...

OK, skip the nonsense. The first purpose of this site is make myself a public
identification. The second purpose is for taking notes. I find myself not have
a good memory, so I need somewhere to put my thoughts down.

As this time, my grammar is bad. My words may be lengthy. If you find it's hard
too read, I'm sorry. Any feedback or suggestion is welcome. You can contact me
at [letientai299@gmail.com](mailto:letientai299@gmail.com)
