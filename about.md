Hi, friend!

Thanks for visiting my blog. My name is Le Tien Tai. I’m a novice programmer from Viet Nam. I like solving problems, even though sometimes, my solutions make thing worse. Besides coding, I also love cooking, reading, and playing organ.

Before, I have tried WordPress and Blogger, then give up. The two frameworks are complex, and, I don’t like the feeling that I cannot control everything on my site. Jekyll is a better solution. So here it is, my seriously blog. I will share here my experience, some of my thoughts and stuffs that I feel cool. Hope you find this site useful.

Any feedback or suggestion is welcome, especially about my English usage.
