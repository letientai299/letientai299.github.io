About me
--------

Hi, friend!

Thanks for visiting my blog. My name is Le Tien Tai (in English, I think it
would be Tai Le Tien, for you not to be confused).

I'm a Java developer. Sometimes, I also work with C++.

I love problems solving, and programming is a kind of that such thing. Besides
that, I also love cooking, reading, and playing music.

Currently, I'm learning the Unix utilities: bash, zsh, vim, ssh,... Vim's
actually my main editor on all operating system (well, I even try to use
Vim-like keybinding as much as posible for my daily work).

About this site
---------------

On this site, I share my thoughts and experience. Knowledge should be sharing.
Let's share to be share...

Ok, skip the nonsense. The first purpose of this site is make myself a public
identification. The second purpose is for taking notes. I find myself not have
a good memory, so I need somewhere to put my thoughts down.

As this time, my grammar is bad. My words may be lenghty. If you find it's hard
too read, I'm sorry. Any feedback or suggestion is welcome. You can contact me at
[letientai299@gmail.com](mailto:letientai299@gmail.com)
