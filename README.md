TODO
----

- Minify css.
- Dark theme is not really nice. Check color contrast again.
- Serve js and css using rawgit or other CDN to enable browser caching.
- Hook in post commit.
- Serve img via cdn.
- Embed SVG images in HTML
- Separate color and layout in Css. Embeded and load color only when js is
  available to avoid conflict.
- Blog about the change.


Notes
-----

- Rawgit is awesome. Just change the hash.
